# CMPDA – Cognitive Micro-Pattern Drift Analytics

### A Unique Data Analytics Project Using Behavioural Micro-Patterns

This project analyzes tiny digital behaviour patterns such as:

- Mouse movement drift  
- Scroll velocity changes  
- Click frequency & burst patterns  
- Idle-time behaviour  
- Micro attention oscillations  
- Behaviour drift over time  

The dataset used in this project is **100% self-generated**, making this a completely unique data analytics project that no one else has built.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To detect and visualize **Cognitive Micro-Pattern Drift** — tiny changes in a person’s behaviour that indicate:

- Focus level  
- Stress level  
- Digital fatigue  
- Multi-tasking behaviour  
- Attention stability  

All visualized through **Power BI** and **Tableau** interactive dashboards.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python (data collection + preprocessing)  
- Power BI (behaviour drift dashboard)  
- Tableau (pattern heatmaps & anomaly visualization)  
- GitHub (version control + project portfolio)  

---

## ⭐ Why This Project Is Special

- Dataset is **self-collected**, not downloaded  
- Concept is **not available anywhere online**  
- Visualizations are **completely original**  
- Shows deeper analytics skills (behavioural + cognitive data)

## 🚀 Status

- Step 1: GitHub setup ✔️  
- Step 2: Dataset collection (next step)  
- Step 3: Data cleaning  
- Step 4: Dashboard building
